Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

The original code will be prior than promise (resolve() and reject()).
For example, “returning from sum” was logged before any messages from promise.
Besides, the promise will be prior than setTimeout().
For example: The immediate reject in sumPromise2 runs before  setTimeout, hence the “BAD INPUT: Expected array as input” was logged before the “resolving…” and””45”.
